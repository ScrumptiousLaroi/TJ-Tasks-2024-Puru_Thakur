### Q1 Pascal's Triangle 
1) I tried accessing the last row in each iteration but im excluding the last element (i.e. 1) and then I append last rows adjacent elements sum in each iteration (except the last element) after the loop I append last element (i.e.) and store it in triangles variable
2) I initially had problem accessing the last element of an array. Here, "triangle" is my global array which is storing every row which iterates and provides a row of pascal triangle, "row" is my temporary variable which resets after every iteration

### Q2 You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top. Each time you can either climb 1 step or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
1) This relates to fibonacci sequence logic that number of ways you can climb a stair is sum of ways you can climb last and 2nd last stair
2) I approached to this logic from a theoretical maths question back while preparing for jee, I applied the same logic in code. (using recursion)
